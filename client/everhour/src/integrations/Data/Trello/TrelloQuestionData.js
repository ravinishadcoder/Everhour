      "After you register an Everhour account and connect it with Trello, you can track time only for yourself. To invite teammates, you should go to the Everhour team page and manually invite your team by entering their emails. Each employee should finish the signup flow and connect their Trello account.",

    detail:
      "As of now, you can’t see the Everhour timer and other controls inside Trello desktop and mobile apps. But we definitely look into ways to change that. One of the next things to try is to build our “power-up”, which is a way to make a cross-platform integration with Trello. It could become a solution, but for a desktop app only. The mobile app still doesn't officially support third-party apps.",
