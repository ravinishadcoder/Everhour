      "Yes. Just click Try with my ClickUp and connect it with Everhour. The next step would be to install our browser extension. And that's it! Open your ClickUp and start tracking time.",

    title: "How does Everhour for ClickUp work?",
    detail:
      "After integration, Everhour embeds controls into the ClickUp interface and thus extends it with many useful features. You can keep tracking time from ClickUp, through the Everhour website or browser extension.",

    title: "Why choose Everhour for time tracking in ClickUp? ",
    detail:
      "ClickUpâ€™s native time tracker is simple and easy to use. However, it is quite basic and lacks some essential time tracking features. For example, time approval, tracking vacations, and other leave types, project billing and budgeting, invoices based on tracked time and expenses, etc. No time tracker can ever compete with ClickUp in terms of project management. But, at the same time, time tracking always requires in-depth, individual attention. The best apps focus on just one thing and do it really, really well.",

  {
    title: "What if not all my ClickUp users need time tracking?",
    detail:
      "No problem. You can invite and pay only for those ClickUp users who are going to track time and use other Everhour features.",
  },
  {
    title: "Will someone else (like clients) see my time?",
    detail:
      "Only those people who are a part of your Everhour team and installed our browser extension can see time-related data in ClickUp.",
  },
  {
    title: "Does Everhour work on ClickUp native apps?",
    detail:
      "Unfortunately, it is not possible due to technical reasons. Only folks at ClickUp can decide to integrate with Everhour. Other time trackers can't do this either.",
